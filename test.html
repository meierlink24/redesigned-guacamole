<h1 class="header_1"> ABOUT ME</h1>
<p class="paragraph_1">
    Hey, I'm an 18-year-old tech enthusiast from Serbia who loves mixing creativity with code. Whether I'm developing websites with Anime.js and scroll animations or integrating C++ backend logic into 3D worlds built in Blender and Godot, I always aim for precision, style, and impact.
    <br><br>
    I care deeply about quality—whether it's stainless steel jewelry with crystal details, or making sure my website fonts match the pixel-art theme of the project. I’m also into reptiles, especially bearded dragons, and I’m building a custom bioactive terrarium for a future rescue. I’m thoughtful, patient, and passionate about what I do.

    Education
</h3>
<p class="paragraph_2">
    I’m currently in my final year of high school, sharpening my skills in calculus (derivatives and integrals), C++, and advanced math. I've studied math up to a 4th-year university level and am actively preparing myself for a career in tech. I’m constantly exploring new challenges—especially online opportunities for competitions, projects, and learning.

    EXPERIENCE
</h3>
<p class="paragraph_3">
    I’ve built responsive, animated websites with scroll reveal, pixel art, and e-commerce functionality. I’ve designed full-stack C++ applications to handle images, videos, and zip-logic for user-based access. I’ve integrated Blender animations into game engines like Godot and used custom tools to manage shaders, transformations, and camera control.
    <br><br>
    I'm also building a massive custom terrarium for a bearded dragon, complete with a bioactive setup and research into bugs that help clean the ecosystem. My projects reflect both technical capability and attention to real-world detail, always with a creative twist.
